# ForLoopsDemo

This project demonstrates the usage of 'for' loops in Java. It includes examples of simple for loops, nested loops to generate a multiplication table, and the use of for-each loops to iterate over arrays. The purpose is to show different forms and applications of for loops in Java programming.

Key features:
- Basic for loops
- Nested for loops
- For-each loop to iterate over an array
